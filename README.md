# FAQ

1. Why is code missing from the bot?

Not everything is public (yet). Somethings must stay private as it takes time to develop and work on.

2. Can I clone this repo and use the code?

Yes, just make sure you give credits and understand the basics before coding. If you need a relevant [2020] beginners video for how to make a Discord.js bot [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpg0J3Co6ww).

3. How can I join the development team?

Contact the bot's owner. We can discuss more there.
